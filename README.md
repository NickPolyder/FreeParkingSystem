# Free Parking System

This repo is created as a contribution to my personal portfolio.   
The **_Free Parking System_** is being developed on my spare time.   
With this repo i'm looking to:

- [x] Improve my skills on TDD and unit testing.
- [x] Learn / use microservices.
- [x] Learn / use Docker.


I expect the repo to continuously change file structure and shape as i learn 
and explore/tackle with the problems.
